## Zagreus Tuner Dataset
This directory contains the Zagreus Tuner Dataset. The dataset is a file in the [Extended Position Description (EDP)](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Extended_Position_Description) format, that contains all positions that were used to tune the evaluation paramaters of Zagreus. The dataset mainly consists of positions extracted from games played by top engines on [CCRL](https://ccrl.chessdom.com).
The actual end result of a game from white's perspective is represented with a "c9" comment. Example:
```  
r1bq1rk1/pp1p1pbp/4p1p1/nPP5/3nP3/2N3P1/3PNPBP/1RBQK2R b K - c9 1-0
```
